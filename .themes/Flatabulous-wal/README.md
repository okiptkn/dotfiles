# Flatabulous-wal

This is a fork of Flatabulous that includes some minor changes to make it compatible with the colors that are generated by [wal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). This fork will stay up to date with upstream and won't be merged into the main `wal` repository.

(Below are snippets from the original README.)
