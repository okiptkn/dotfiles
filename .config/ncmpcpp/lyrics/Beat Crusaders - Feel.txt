The time left me alone
All my friends are gone
Nothing's ever shown
In my eyes

Walking all alone
The sun keep shining on
I found you wander around
In my life

Every time you're around me
Scorchers disappear
So.

I feel so strange
I wanna take you faraway to let you
Feel so strange
I'm gonna keep my journey to the whole new world
